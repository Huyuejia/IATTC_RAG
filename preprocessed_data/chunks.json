If \nthe SSB projection indicates that the probability of achieving the second rebuilding target by 2034, \nor 10 years after reaching the initial rebuilding target, whichever is earlier, is at 75% or larger, \nfishery controls may be changed, including adjustment of catch limits, as long as the probability is \nmaintained at 70% or larger.

A harvest strategy, which includes the elements described in this Resolution, shall be adopted for \nall fisheries which harvest North Pacific albacore tuna in the Convention Area. \nMANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES \na. Considering the overarching objective of ensuring the sustainability of North Pacific \nalbacore tuna and current fisheries supported by the stock in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the \nfollowing management objectives are established: \ni. Maintain Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) above the Limit Reference Point, with \na probability of at least 80% over the next 10 years. \nii. Maintain depletion of total biomass around historical (2006-2015) average \ndepletion over the next 10 years. \niii. Maintain fishing intensity (F) at or below the target reference point with a \nprobability of at least 50% over the next 10 years. \niv. To the extent practicable, management changes (e.g., catch and/or effort) should \nbe relatively gradual between years. \nREFERENCE POINTS \nb. For the purpose of the North Pacific albacore harvest strategy, the following reference \npoints are established: \ni. Target reference point (TRP) = F45%, which is the fishing intensity (F) level that \nresults in the stock producing 45% of spawning potential ratio (SPR). \nii. Threshold reference point (SSBthreshold) = 30%SSBcurrent,F=0, which is 30% of the \ndynamic unfished spawning stock biomass. \niii. Limit reference point (LRP) =14%SSBcurrent,F=0, which is 14% of the dynamic \nunfished spawning stock biomass. \n--- 第 3 页 ---\nACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF RISK \nc. The risk of breaching the Limit Reference Point based on the most current estimate of SSB \nshall be no greater than 20%. \nMONITORING \nd. The IATTC staff shall collaborate with the ISC to conduct regular stock assessments of \nNorth Pacific albacore tuna every three years, at which time status relative to reference \npoint in paragraph 1.b. will be evaluated. \ne. When performing a stock assessment, IATTC staff shall collaborate with the ISC to \nconsider the criteria for identification of exceptional circumstances developed by the ISC, \nand notify the IATTC if these exceptional circumstances have occurred. \nHARVEST CONTROL RULES \nf. The harvest control rules apply to all fisheries harvesting albacore in the Convention Area \nnorth of the equator. \ng. The harvest control rule parameters produce a relationship between stock status and fishing \nintensity, as shown in Figure 1, and are as follows with the minimum allowed fishing \nintensity (Fmin) equal to F87%, which is the fishing intensity (F) level that results in the \nstock producing 87% of spawning potential ratio (SPR). SSBcurrent refers to spawning stock \nbiomass in the terminal year of the assessment and SSBcurrent, F=0 to the terminal year \ndynamic unfished spawning stock biomass. \ni. If SSBcurrent/SSBcurrent, F=0 is above or equal to SSBthreshold with a probability of at least \n50%, fishing intensity shall be maintained at or below the TRP on average over 10 \nyears. \nii. If SSBcurrent/SSBcurrent, F=0 is below SSBthreshold with a probability greater than 50%, \nand is above the LRP with a probability of at least 50%, fishing intensity shall be \nreduced1 to a level in accordance with following formula: \nF = \n𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇−𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹\n𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜−𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿*(SSBcurrent/SSBcurrent,F=0 – LRP) + Fmin \niii. If SSBcurrent/SSBcurrent, F=0 is at or below the LRP with a probability greater than 50%, \nthe IATTC shall, in collaboration with the ISC and in coordination with the \nWCPFC, adopt rebuilding measures that will rebuild SSB to levels of at least the \nSSBthreshold with a probability of at least 65 % within 10 years of SSBcurrent/SSBcurrent, \nF=0 having been identified to be at or below the LRP with a probability greater than \n50%. In the absence of such rebuilding measures, fishing intensity shall be set at \nFmin.2 \nh. If SSBcurrent/SSB current, F=0 is above the LRP and below SSBthreshold, the maximum increase or \ndecrease in catch or effort between the three-year management periods shall be 20% \n1 When adopting proposed revisions to the conservation and management measures proposed, which may include inter \nalia reductions in fishing effort, CPCs will take into account historical fishing activity and the source of increased \nfishing mortality in reference to the average effort referenced in Resolution C-05-02. \n2 Ibid. \n--- 第 4 页 ---\nrelative to the catch and effort levels specified for the previous year. \nIn the year following the relevant ISC stock assessment, the IATTC will recommend \nadjustment to the existing Resolution for North Pacific Albacore to ensure fishing intensity \nis at or below the level set forth by this HCR using the latest ISC stock assessment. Changes \nto fishing intensity in accordance with the harvest control parameters (paragraph 1.g) shall \napply between assessments starting the year after the stock assessment was completed, \nuntil the year following the next stock assessment that provides an estimate of unfished \nSSB. \nThe IATTC scientific staff in 2024 shall collaborate with the ISC to advise how fishing \nintensity should be interpreted to actual management under this harvest strategy. \nOTHER PROVISIONS \n2. The Commission shall promote compatibility between the harvest strategy adopted through this \nResolution and the harvest strategy adopted by the WCPFC with respect to North Pacific albacore \ntuna. \n3. A review of the performance of the harvest strategy by the IATTC and IATTC scientific staff, in \ncollaboration with the ISC, shall be completed by 2030 and 2033. The aim of the review is to ensure \nthat the harvest strategy is performing as expected and to determine whether there are conditions \nthat justify its continuation, or that warrant: reconditioning the MSE operating models; retuning the \nexisting harvest strategy; including new indices into a new harvest strategy; and/or considering \nalternate candidate management procedures or development of a new MSE framework. Based on \nthose reviews and subsequent advice from the IATTC scientific staff, the IATTC in 2030 and 2033 \nshall decide on the future of the harvest strategy. \n4. The Director shall communicate this Resolution to the WCPFC Secretariat. \n--- 第 5 页 ---\nFIGURE. 1.

To reduce the entanglement of sharks, marine turtles or any other species, CPCs shall ensure that, as of \nthe 1st of January 2025, the design and construction of any FADs to be deployed or redeployed (i.e., \nwill be placed in the water) in the IATTC area of competence shall comply with the following \nspecifications in accordance with Annex I: \na) the use of mesh net shall be prohibited for any part of a FAD; \nb) only non-entangling FAD materials and designs shall be used. \n3. To reduce the amount of synthetic marine debris: \na) as of 1 January 2026, CPCs shall only allow vessels to deploy or redeploy drifting FADs of \nbiodegradability categories I, II, III or IV, as defined in Annex I; \nb) as of 1 January 2029, CPCs shall only allow vessels to deploy or redeploy drifting FADs of \ncategories I or II, as defined in Annex I; \nc) At the annual meeting in 2030, the Commission shall decide whether to require by 2031 CPCs to \nonly allow vessels to deploy or redeploy drifting FADs of Category I, as defined in Annex I. \n4. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, the use of non-biodegradable materials, in particular nylon ropes, can be \nused exclusively to strengthen the structure of the floating or underwater component of the FAD \ncategories I & II, as a temporary solution and only provided no biodegradable alternative is available. \n5.

In 2025, the IATTC, Scientific Staff in collaboration with the IATTC SAC and EBWG shall \ndevelop and recommend to the Commission a Shark Research Plan that will prioritize research \nactivities for Carcharhinus longimanus and C. falciformis, Sphyrna lewini, S. zygaena, Alopias \npelagicus, Alopias supercilicious, Prionace glauca, and S. mokarran,and as appropriate, the other \nspecies listed in Annex 4. This Shark Research Plan will include timelines and financial \nconsiderations for stock assessments, ecological risk assessments, and recommended management \nstrategy evaluations. This plan will also identify opportunities for collaboration with the Western \nand Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) for Pacific-wide stocks. \n16. Beginning in 2026 and annually thereafter, the IATTC scientific staff, in collaboration with the \nSAC and EBWG, shall provide an update on the Shark Research Plan at the SAC and \nrecommendations to the Commission, as appropriate. \n17. The IATTC SAC with support from Scientific Staff and the EBWG shall review the information \nreported by CPCs annually and will, as necessary, provide recommendations to the Commission \non ways to strengthen the conservation and management of sharks within IATTC fisheries, \nincluding consideration of the use of wire leaders, by vessels fishing tuna and tuna like species. \n18. By 2027, CPCs will undertake, where possible, in cooperation with the IATTC scientific staff, \nactions to: \na. identify ways to make fishing gears more selective, where appropriate, including research \ninto alternative measures to wire leaders; \nb. improve knowledge of key biological and ecological parameters, life-history and \nbehavioral traits, and migration patterns of key shark species; \nc. identify key shark mating, pupping, and nursery areas; and \nd. improve handling practices for live sharks to maximize their post-release survival. \nREPORTING AND DATA COLLECTION \n19. The Commission shall consider appropriate assistance to developing CPCs for the identification \nof shark species/groups and the collection of data on their shark catches. \n20. Each CPC shall annually report data for catches, effort by gear type landing and trade of sharks, \nby species where possible, in accordance with IATTC reporting procedures, including available \nhistorical data, of the fisheries under the purview of the Commission. \n21. CPCs are encouraged to provide aggregated information on trade, as available. \n22. CPCs shall also provide to the IATTC, through observer programs, electronic monitoring programs \nor other means, the species identification, the number and status (dead/alive) of all sharks caught, \nin accordance with applicable monitoring requirements, including those caught incidentally and/or \nreleased by purse seine vessels of all capacity classes and longline vessels. \n23. The IATTC Secretariat will develop a template for CPCs to report on the implementation of this \nResolution for adoption by the Commission in 2024. \n24. In 2025, CPCs shall use the annual compliance questionnaire to report on their compliance with \nthis Resolution. \n--- 第 6 页 ---\n25. In 2026, CPCs shall use the reporting template provided by the Staff to annually report on its \nimplementation of this Resolution. Reports for the previous year shall be submitted to the IATTC \nSecretariat, by June 30 of each year. \nREPEAL AND ENTRY INTO FORCE \n26. This Resolution shall replace Resolution C-23-07 upon its entry into force on July 1, 2025. \nAnnex 1 \nSchematic diagram of shark lines and wire leaders \nBuoy lines: individual lines or leaders that are attached to the float line or to the floats directly, and that \nare constructed of steel, metal, wire trace, or other materials, and are deployed in the water column at \ndepths shallower than the mainline3. \nWire leaders: individual lines or leaders that are constructed of steel, metal, or wire trace, and that are \nattached to the main line or a branch line. \n3 These are also commonly known as “shark lines.” \nBuoy lines \nBuoy lines \nBranchlines \n--- 第 7 页 ---\nAnnex 2 \nDiagram of allowable partial cuts \nNaturally attached means that all fins of the shark must be fully and/or partially connected to the body \nof the shark by connective tissue or cartilage, while at sea. In order to facilitate on-board storage, shark \nfins may be partially sliced through and folded against the shark carcass, but shall not be removed from \nthe carcass until the first point of landing. Below is a schematic to guide fishers. \n1. Only head and guts, as appropriate, may be removed at sea. \n2. A partial cut at the level of the base of the dorsal fin and the base of the pectoral fins is permitted. \n3. A partial cut at the level of the caudal peduncle of the base, allowing the caudal fin to be folded over \nthe posterior area of the shark’s trunk is permitted. \n4. A full cut along the abdominal section is permitted in the case of the Blue Shark (P. glauca) in the \nprocess of gutting, provided the fins remain naturally attached. \n--- 第 8 页 ---\nAnnex 3 \nBest safe handling and release practices (BHRPs) for sharks \nBearing in mind that the primary aim of release processes is to ensure the highest level of survival of sharks \nand that, whenever possible, prompt, and effective action will be taken to return the shark to the sea and \nprioritizing that the life and safety of the crew is not compromised and that crew members shall endeavor \nto avoid hazards in the safe handling and release operations for sharks. \nTo maximize the efficacy and utility of adopted BHRPs, CPCs should ensure crew are educated and trained \nby qualified staff on these practices regularly. Illustrated best handling and release practices should be \navailable on the vessels. \n All fisheries \nSHOULD \nRelease the shark in the water, if possible. \nEncourage the immediate release of sharks. \nSHOULD NOT \nAttach sharks to vessel and drag while vessel operations are underway \nHit or kick the shark \nLeave sharks laying on the deck, exposed to sun or air, except to the extent necessary to carry out \nthese practices \nInsert hands into gill slits. \nPurse-seine fishery \nSHOULD NOT \nRoll sharks through the power block \nFor sharks entangled in the net: \nSHOULD Release the shark from the net, always preventing it from ascending to the power block. \nManeuver the animal into a stretcher/cradle or ramp and release it on the opposite side of the vessel. \nWhen brailing sharks on board: \nSHOULD \nAccording to the vessel’s conditions, to the extent possible, use bycatch reduction devices (BRDs; \ne.g., hoppers or ramps) to ensure sharks are sorted on the main deck and do not go down the loading \nhatch. \nRelease the shark as soon as possible. The recommended practice is to remove the shark from the \nbrailer, hopper or ramps by grabbing it, without suspending it, by the caudal peduncle to place it \non deck. This should be done manually whenever possible. \nManeuver sharks into a stretcher/cradle or ramp immediately when possible and release it on the \nopposite side of the vessel from the net. \nConsider the use of a bycatch/waste ramp on the lower decks to facilitate fast and safe release of \nsharks that were not sighted on the main/working deck. \n--- 第 9 页 ---\nFor whale sharks \nSHOULD \nLeave whale sharks in the water for release. \nRelease of whale sharks prior to brailing. \nIf the whale shark is at the side of the vessel and its head is pointed towards the stern of the vessel, \nthe shark should be released ( by opening or cutting the net in front of the sharks mouth) \nIf the head of the whale shark is pointed towards the bow of the boat, the crew in charge of the net \nhauling operation can maneuver the winch and the capstan to bring the whale shark close to the \nhull, then stand the animal on the net and roll it outside the bunt. \nSHOULD NOT \nLand a whale shark on deck regardless of size \nStart a brailing process if it endangers the survival of the whale shark. \nPull or drag whale sharks out of the net by the tail or caudal peduncle. \n Longline fishery (also applicable to fisheries of other surface fleets other than purse seine) \n SHOULD \nFor sharks captured by vessels with high freeboard (>2m): \nSlow the vessel to bring the sharks alongside for identification and removal of gear. \nAvoid removing hooks from sharks. If attempting to remove hooks use long-handled de-hookers \nfor vessels with high freeboards. \nTo the extent practicable and ensure that weights are removed, when cutting the line. \nAvoid bringing sharks on board for gear removal if possible. If sharks are brought on board for \ngear removal: \no Use a dip net or lasso to help lift them onboard \no Use a stretcher or cradle for handling and restraint for the safety of the crew and to reduce \ninjury to the animal. \no Maneuver shark using manual restraint of the pectoral fins and the caudal peduncle (this \nmay require two crew members depending on the size of the animals \nFor all longline vessels (also applicable to surface fleet fisheries): \nSHOULD NOT \nDrag sharks behind the vessel until the hook rips free of the jaw. \nLift sharks onboard without the use of a dipnet and or second point of attachment to support the \nweight of the animal, noting it is not recommended to lift sharks onboard the vessel. \nAttempt to remove a hook from a live shark if the hook is not visible. \nInsert gaffs, hooks, or similar instruments into the bodies of live sharks \nCut into the jaw for removal of the hook. \nLift sharks onto the deck if possible. \nAnnex",

EM analysts shall not be \nemployees of a fishing vessel company involved in the observed fishery or have other direct \nconflicts of interest. \nAutomation \nWhen feasible, make EM data generation automatic and user-friendly to expedite EM analysis and \ndirectly include information in EM data or reports. \nEM records subject to EM analysis shall contain at least the vessel name and vessel ID and trip \nID, camera number, geolocation data (date, time (UTC), latitude and longitude), sensor data where \napplicable, camera recording status and EM equipment system status, where available, and \nimages. \nData quality \nThe EM analysis should involve a dedicated software, which shall permit the analysis of all the \nstored data, images, and sensor data where applicable, in a synchronized way. CPCs shall ensure \nthat data analysis procedures ensure traceability and effective analysis of data and routines to flag \npotential errors, and digital measuring tools. \nThe EM analysis software shall allow reporting the mandatory minimum data fields requirements \nestablished in Tables 1 and 2 of Annex 3 (Areas of fishing activities under coverage by EMS and \nminimum data requirements for vessel type). It may also allow reporting of the voluntary data \nfields. \nConversion factors \nStandardized species-specific length-weight and weight-number conversion factors, based on \npeer-reviewed research results and/or empirical data, should be developed by the IATTC \nSecretariat, endorsed by the SAC and adopted by the Commission, and updated as necessary. \nFormat \nStandard formats applicable to human observers reporting should be used for generating EM data \nfields (e.g., dates as DDMMYY, latitude and longitude in decimal units, speeds in knots, weights \nin kg, lengths in centimeters) and creating resulting EM data files (e.g., csv, accdb, xlsx). \nReporting procedure \nEM data should be submitted via a dedicated cloud-based portal which may be developed by \nthe IATTC Secretariat, or other appropriate means. The portal should be as user-friendly and \nautomated as possible, and include quality control procedures (e.g., format checking, error \nflagging), as well as automatic reminders for the timely submission of EM data.",
